# Sign-language-detection
Developed a real-time sign language detection system utilizing action detection techniques. Key components included:
• Keypoint Extraction: Employed MediaPipe to extract holistic keypoints from video sequences.
• Model Development: Designed a deep neural network with LSTM layers to recognize sign language
gestures.
• Real-Time Prediction: Implemented real-time processing to classify and predict sign language
gestures based on live keypoint analysis.
